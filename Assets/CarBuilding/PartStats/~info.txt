NAME IS ALWAYS THE FIRST LINE.

WHEEL: Edits most properties in the WheelCollider
mass (float 1-100)
Wheel Damping Rate (damps the wheel) (float 0-1 default 0.01)
Suspension Distance (....?) (float 0-1)
Force App Point Distance (some kinda acceleration thing??) (float 0-1)
forward stiffness (acceleration, higher numbers make it unstable) (int/float 1+)
sideways stiffness (turning something??) (int/float 1+)
